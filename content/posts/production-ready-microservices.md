**In this blog article, I want to explain how to get easily started with a microservice written in Java with Spring Boot. Aiming to show what is needed to have this service ready for production on a Kubernetes environment. Covering the DevSecOps best practices.**

This is the first post of my "fully automated production-ready microservices" series.

This article includes my experience of building stable (code quality, maintainability) software intended to provide a solid start point for your next greenfield project.

Feel free to jump directly into my quick-starter-template on GitHub to start right away with your new production-ready microservice: [springboot-java-microservice-quickstarter](https://github.com/botscripter/springboot-java-microservice-quickstarter)
