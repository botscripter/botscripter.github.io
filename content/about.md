First and foremost: **I’m introducing software ideas to the real world. And are keeping them running …**

Ever since I was a little kid, computers have been my passion. I still remember the first try to upgrade my PC, which entertained me with a firework-like show after turning on the power switch. Fortunately, a friend and I got away with just a broken power fuse. 

Currently, I’m leading my international and agile software engineering teams which I built up from ground at [UMB](www.umb.ch) with the aim to create time for us and our customers. My main responsibility is to design and develop a cloud native SaaS platform for process automation in a multi-tenant microservice architecture with Java/Kotlin, Spring Boot and Angular.

Previously, I developed high-available health-care systems for Swiss hospitals and later for family doctors. Heavily based on relational data structures. Started during my time at the vocational school paid side projects in Java and achieved to self-fund my first Company: Viascom Ltd liab. Co. together with two colleagues. Where we crafted in cooperation with the sport faculty of the university of Heidelberg and a German corporation a software solution for gyms to take efficient care of their customers. Continued with manufacturing business apps on Android with Java. Consulted insurances, banks, and other financial service providers how to implement reliable digital transformation projects with BPM. 

Still my emotional biggest success in the IT world was, when I got nominated for one of the top three projects by [CH Open Source Awards](https://www.ch-open.ch/). Can't forget the time I arrived in Zurich, regarding I'm from a much smaller city, the impression was overwhelming ... The presentation in front of the audience back then was the start point of my today's strength and motivation. Since then open-source has secured a special place in my heart.

Even when I leave the office. I tend to continue writing code at home. This is what keeps me up at night, a never ending thirst to create beautiful, powerful things and share them with the world. Next to coding I’m spending my leisure time with my wife, my dog Simba and a lot of travelling.  While I’m trying not to miss any chances of doing something creative ([stans.pictures](www.stans.pictures)).

**I believe that software can improve the lives of people around the world.**
