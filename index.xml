This is the first post of my &amp;ldquo;fully automated production-ready microservices&amp;rdquo; series.
This article includes my experience of building stable (code quality, maintainability) software intended to provide a solid start point for your next greenfield project.</description></item><item><title>Production-ready microservice with Spring Boot written in Java</title><link>http://www.botscripter.io/posts/production-ready-microservices/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Feb 2021 00:30:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://www.botscripter.io/posts/production-ready-microservices/</guid><description>In this blog article, I want to explain how to get easily started with a microservice written in Java with Spring Boot.
